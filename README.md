# Food_ordering-
I have creating a project through the swing concept in the java . it is a simple project .
there are mainly 3 concept use in my Food ordering project .
firstly I was extending main class from Jframe class and create a one button , one Jlabal , or three checkbox . then after some time I seen a error in my computer screen . 
My button is not working properly . then I implement a Action Listener interface in our main class .
so my main program are not working properly . some hour are missing left. finally my project working properly .
